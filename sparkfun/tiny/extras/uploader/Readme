It's been tested casually on Mac, Windows, and Linux, and aught to work on all
three. To make and install, do the regular 'make; sudo make install' on unixes.
On windows just 'make' with mingw and do whatever people do with windows exes.

Usage on Ubuntu:
  sudo micronucleus --run name_of_the_file.hex
Usage on Mac:
  micronucleus --run name_of_the_file.hex
Usage on Windows
  micronucleus.exe --run name_of_the_file.hex

Raw binary file writing hasn't been tested as much as hex files.

Every now and then the program fails once it reaches the Writing stage - this is
a known bug - but if you simply rerun the micronucleus command immediately, it
will succeed the second time usually. Most of the time this issue is not present.

To linux users: sudo is used above because the default configuration under most
modern linux distributions is to not allow userspace apps to communicate
directly to unknown USB devices. You can fix this by installing some config
files, or you can just use sudo. Either way you're going to need root. To
configure your system to allow micronucleus access from non-root users, copy
49-micronucleus.rules from this folder to /etc/udev/rules.d/

To Build
--------

You might want to re-compile the micronucleus uploader tool if you plan to use
different USB VID/PID identifiers. To start, change the MICRONUCLEUS_VENDOR_ID
and MICRONUCLEUS_PRODUCT_ID constants in library/micronucleus_lib.h to your
VID/PID pair. Then compile for your operating system:

Ubuntu:
  sudo apt-get install libusb-dev
  make
  cp micronucleus builds/linux64
  make clean
Mac:

Windows: 
  Install MinGW and MSYS. Navigate to this directory and enter "make". Copy
  micronucleus.exe to wherever you need it and enter "make clean" to remove 

To zip the tool for Arduino, move to the directory with your build (e.g.
builds/windows), create a version directory (e.g. 2.03-SFE), copy the
executable to that directory, and enter:
  tar -cvjSf micronucleus-2.03-SFE-windows.tar.bz2 2.03-SFE/
